DEVENG ADDRESS1            DF0000000010    then the street number of the apartment block. Thus the address
DEVENG ADDRESS1            DF0000000011    "3/4 Hysan Avenue" refers to apartment number 3 in the apartment
DEVENG ADDRESS1            DF0000000012    block with street number 4 on Hysan Avenue.
